 \section{Introduction}
Many real-world problems on the Web like spelling correction \cite{}, 
finding related queries \cite{Jones06WWW,Jain11SIGIR,Song12WSDM}, finding near-duplicate queries \cite{}, 
and diversifying search results \cite{Song11SIGIR} 
can benefit from query logs from a commercial search engine. 
We can take advantage of large-scale query logs 
by computing pairwise similarity between all queries. Each query point also has an associated feature vector, that is
very high dimensional and sparse $\--$ these are the set of webpages (urls) that
get clicked for this query term.

However, computing pairwise similarity between 
all queries on a commercial large-scale query logs (consisting of hundreds of millions of  queries) 
is a computationally time intensive task. 
To solve this problem, we exploit research advances in Locality Sensitive Hashing 
\cite{Indyk98STOC,Charikar02STOC,Andoni06FOCS,Andoni08CACM}  
to propose an efficient approximate similarity Hadoop framework.  


\begin{itemize}
\item We present a distributed system that can approximately compute pairwise similarity 
between all queries on a commercial large-scale query logs in a time efficient manner. 
Can we claim something more specific wrt time (e.g. 0(N logN))?
\item Vanilla LSH 
\item We propose two novel variants of vanilla LSH motivated by the research on Multi-Probe LSH \cite{LvVLDB07}: Random Flipping and Query-Driven Flipping. 
\item  We show that the applicability of our system on two real-world applications like finding related queries (Increasing  direct display coverage is related to finding related queries) and ??.
\end{itemize}

%We are interested in the following setting: given a large set of 
%points $q_1,q_2,\dots,q_n$, each of them is a search-query.
