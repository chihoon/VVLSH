Millions of users visit commercial search engines and  ``query'' their interests.
To provide users with high quality of services, 
search engines such as Bing, Google, and Yahoo require
intelligent analysis to realize users' implicit intents, in particular taking
advantage of very large scaled query logs.  One of the key
interesting tasks involved in learning users' implicit intents often involves 
computing pairwise similarity between all queries.
Due to the large scaled volume that is based on streaming querying, 
computing pairwise similarity is a computationally time intensive task. 
To challenge the aforementioned problem, we exploit  several
Locality Sensitive Hashing (a.k.a, LSH) methods and their novel variants. 
In particular, we develop the framework of LSHs on a distributed system (e.g. Hadoop) to take
advantage of its computing efficiency.
